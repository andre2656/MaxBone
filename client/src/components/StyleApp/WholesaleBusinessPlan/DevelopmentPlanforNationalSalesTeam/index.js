                    <h2> Development Plan for National Sales Team </h2>
                    <p>For expansion: Development and placing a National Team is crucial. <br/>
                    This team will be your relationship managers across the country. Fulfilling, increasing orders and presenting anything new the company has to offer. Once a company gets to the national level, it will be simply too much for corporate to manage. In this case, preparation and a system needs to be put in place for easy work flow. Chain of command, weekly meetings that will go over goals, recapping from prior week, debriefing on present items, rep evaluations, routing and direction.<br /></p>
