                    <p>this strategy should be clear. What is the objective?<br />
                    Is it just to introduce the brand in a new area?<br />
                    Is it to investigate opening a new retail store?<br />
                    Is it to gauge reception for the brand?<br />
                    Is it to piggy back on related events in the area?<br />
                    Is it to scope traffic in the area<br />
                    A map and strategy for each chosen area needs to be planned.<br />
                    A budget needs to be prepared for each pop up<br />
                    A clear objective needs to be set for each location (itâ€™s ok for objectives to vary per location)<br /></p>
